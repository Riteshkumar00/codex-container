✅ Testing Features
Robust testing is integrated into the development workflow to ensure the platform functions as expected and delivers a reliable user experience.

🔍 Unit & Integration Testing
Jest is used for testing JavaScript logic (e.g., form validation, Firebase service wrappers).

Firebase Emulator Suite enables local testing of Firebase Authentication and Database without affecting production data.

🧪 Test Coverage Includes:
✅ Form validation logic (empty fields, valid email format, password length)

✅ User authentication flow (sign up, sign in, error handling)

✅ Database read/write operations (course data, user profiles)

✅ UI responsiveness and component rendering
